# Serial_Data_Logger

A project I want to do to have focused python learning and integrate it with other systems such as embedded. 

The goal of this is to a ) read data from serial input (maybe something else later) of an MCU, and log it.

This should scale later to start plotting the information, potentially with different data streams being implemented on different plots.

Additionally, I want to save and organize the information in a .csv file.
